Farmers in India often face low incomes due to intermediaries in the selling process. Our website offers a solution by providing user login pages for farmers, truck drivers, and an agricultural officer (admin). Farmers can upload crop details and verification documents, while the system notifies truck drivers and is monitored by the agricultural officer to ensure fair pricing without intermediaries. The platform supports regional languages, and an IVR system and app make it easy for farmers to sell crops efficiently.
